            <p>
                Modile 1 supports therapist to guide clients deeply into their felt experience, both in Psychotherapy
                and Non ordinary experiences, as the pathway to deeper, more fundamental insights and subsequent change.
                <br><br>

                The scope of module 1 is primarily on the preparation and integration of clients engaging in Psychedelic
                medicines.<br><br>

                The macro learning outcome is the realigning of psychotherapeutic approach to match and support the
                Characteristics of the psychedelic experience; thus reorienting Mental Health practitioners from a top
                down (thinking) orientation to a bottom up (felt) orientation.<br><br>

                In bridging the triad of Therapist Client and Medicine the learner will navigate 2 key
                directions<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>1. Learning and applying psychotherapeutic skills, approaches, frameworks and lenses that support clients
                to engage via a bottom up, feeling orientation whilst staying in direct relationship with their own
                experience and the therapist. <br><br>
                2. To support the therapist themselves to become more Felt lead, Bottom up and in relationship with
                themselves and their clients.</p>
            <p>Aligning approach to medicine powerfully supports clients to better assimilate their non ordinary
                experiences into integrated wholes at the cognitive, somatic relational and spiritual level. <br><br>

                Being problem focused, cognitive, analytical and “client lead” are important and useful approaches in
                conventional Psychotherapy, although these largely Top-down approaches are insufficient when guiding
                clients through many or most forms of Psychedelic Assisted Psychotherapy.<br><br>

                Learning outcomes to the macro phenomenological movements which Psychedelic Experiences induce.</p>
