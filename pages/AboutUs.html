                Ground up Psychedelic Institute supports Mental Health practitioners to reorient their Psychotherapeutic
                approach to support their clients Bottom up (felt lead) processing, which is activated whilst
                participating
                in Psychedelic Medicine experiences. Bringing attention to clients felt awareness becomes the ground for
                insight, relatedness and reorganisation of self. <br><br>

                Often labelled “non-Ordinary experiences”, Psychedelic medicine experiences are consistently experienced

                <p>Emergent- arising within the broader whole of existence ;
                    An interplay from which ones experience organically emerges . This is quite opposite to a reduction

        <p>As such, when the Psychotherapist is emergent, intra-relational, feeling lead and attends to the here and
            now, the client benefits greatly from the cohesion between their Non ordinary experience and
            Psychotherapeutic approach, furthering both the depth of Non ordinary experience and breadth of integration.

        <h6>What is top down processing and what is Bottom up Processing?</h6>

        <p>To oversimplify, Top down processing sounds like “research suggests 8 glasses of water a day are important”
            bottom up processing sounds like “I feel thirsty, I am going to get a glass of water” The latter is the
            expression of an internally lived and organismic regulated truth, these kinds of truths match the
            phenomenological truths which emerge in Non ordinary states and is why bottom up processing is so important
            to support.</p>

        <h6>Who is this training for?</h6>
